This project was completed for C322 Object-Oriented design patterns

This program is a game called Common Pool Resources. CPR is a game in which multiple
players compete for valuable resources. The player is represented as a dot and the resources
as varying shades of green. The darker the green the more resource that spot has.
The game is designed to run on a server which accepts multiple clients.

This was completed as part of a group project in which a lot of code was passed around.
